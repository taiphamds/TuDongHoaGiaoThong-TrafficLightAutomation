# Intelligent Transportation System – Personal Project
This project proposes an algorithm to calculate green light durations based on the number of vehicles waiting at red lights on each individual road at an intersection(Read summary.pdf for more details).

## Key Features
- Vehicle detection using YOLOv10
- Dynamic algorithm for green light timing adjustment
- User-friendly GUI with live traffic simulation

## Tools and Libraries

- Python
- YOLOv10 (Computer Vision)
- OpenCV
- Tkinter (GUI)
- NumPy
